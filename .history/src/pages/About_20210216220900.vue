          <p>Angola is home to a population of 31,825,295[1] people, 
            including 50.5%[2] women and 46.6%[3] children under age 15. 
            The population is mostly urban, with 66.2%[4] of people living 
            in urban areas. Portuguese is the official language, but Angolans 
            speak many other languages, including Umbundu, Kikongo, Kimbundu, 
            Chokwe, and Luvale, among others. The majority of the population 
            are Bantu peoples, including Ovimbundu, Mbundu, and Bakongo, and 
            other ethnic groups include the Lunda-Chokwe, Nyaneka-Nkumbi, Ambo, 
            Herero, San, and Kwisi. Angolans mainly practice Indigenous beliefs 
            and Christianity.[5] In 2005, a legal quota for 30% of legislative 
            seats and positions in sub-national governing bodies to be held by 
            women was introduced, which has been met.[6] Other gender equality 
            commitments in recent years include the approval of a national plan 
            of action on women, peace, and security; the establishment of the 
            Multisectoral Council to implement an executive plan against domestic 
            violence; and the implementation of a national policy on gender equality 
            and equity.[7] Effective as of 2021, same-sex acts have been decriminalized 
            and broad protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
            orientation instated.[8]
